You can't.

= Can you add support for Windows Me? How about my Pentium II? =
Support for older operating systems and processors will not be added unless a
contributor steps up to build and maintain them. All active contributors are on
modern systems and busy with higher priority tasks. Whether the emulator runs on
Windows Vista or not doesn't matter if it can't run games.

= Does Xenia run on Linux or macOS? =
Not natively, but Xenia runs with Wine on Linux.*
* [https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/Quickstart#minimum D3D12 will only work on Windows 10+ due to vkd3d not being supported.]

macOS is not compatible due to requiring MoltenVK/Metal support which isn't implemented in Xenia.

See the guide in [https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/Quickstart#How-to-rip-games Quickstart].

Check the [https://github.com/xenia-project/game-compatibility/issues compatibility list]. If it's not there, ask in the [https://discord.gg/Q9mxZf9 Discord #help channel] or test it yourself.

= Saves =
== Why aren't saves working? (Storage device not found/full/not detected, etc) ==
Saves are broken in some games in Xenia, especially ones with user profile saves.

As for saves, etc that worked previously in older builds of Xenia, create a text file in the same directory as xenia.exe named <code>portable.txt</code>.

== Where are saves stored? ==
Saves are in <code>Documents\xenia\content</code> by default.

If a <code>portable.txt</code> file is in the same directory as xenia.exe it will be in the same directory as xenia.exe.

<!--== How do I transfer saves to/from Xenia? ==

= Input =
Xenia only supports XInput controllers by default, which includes but is not limited to Xbox 360, and Xbox One controllers.

For non-XInput controllers, [https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/Options#HID_Input SDL] must be used.

<!--You can use the mouse to control the analog/joysticks, and rebind the keyboard controls '''with [x360ce](https://www.x360ce.com/)'''.-->
